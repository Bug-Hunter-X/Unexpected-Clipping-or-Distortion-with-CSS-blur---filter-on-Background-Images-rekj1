This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the `filter: blur()` property when applied to elements with background images. The bug manifests as unexpected clipping or distortion of the blurred background. The solution involves carefully managing the element's size and content to prevent the image from extending beyond the boundaries affected by the blur.
