The CSS property `filter: blur()` is applied to an element with a background image.  The blur effect may not render correctly or may be unexpectedly clipped or distorted, especially if the background image has sharp edges or complex details.  This is because the blur is applied to the entire element, including its background, and the clipping or distortion can occur if the image extends beyond the element's boundaries or if complex image interactions are involved.
